CABAL FILE MAINTENANCE

To build tst portion of the extra source files field of the Cabal
file, git clean the tst directory, type "ls -1 tst/*.tst > x", and add
two spaces to the beginning of each line in file x.  In the cabal
file, delete the tst section of the field, add in two lines, insert
file x between the lines, add "tst/README" and "tst/Makefile", fill
the region, and then delete the two lines.

MAKE A DISTRIBUTION

To make a source distribution, type:

make sdist

VERSIONING

TESTING
