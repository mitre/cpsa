<h1>CPSA</h1>

<p>The Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer (CPSA) attempts to enumerate all
essentially different executions possible for a cryptographic protocol. We call
them the <i>shapes</i> of the protocol. Naturally occurring protocols have only
finitely many, indeed very few shapes. Authentication and secrecy properties
are easy to determine from them, as are attacks and anomalies.</p>

<p>CPSA comes with a user guide, a primer, an overview, and some slides.
  The user guide provides usage information for each program in the
  CPSA package.  The primer provides an English language description
  of the CPSA algorithm and is the primary user documentation.  The
  overview is another attack at user documentation and includes an
  introduction to the Rely-Guarantee Method of demonstrating that a
  protocol achieves its security goals.  This is an advanced technique
  beginners should feel free to ignore.</p>

<p>At this point, new users should open the
  <a href="cpsaintroslides.pdf">introductory slides</a> and start
  using CPSA by analyzing the protocols that come with this document.
  Copy the contents of this directory to a place that allows it to be
  modified.  In a Unix shell, type:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>$ echo build | ghci Make.hs</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In Windows, click on <code>Make.hs</code> and type <code>build</code> at
  the <code>GHCi</code> prompt <code>*Make&gt;</code>.
  The <a href="cpsauser.html#make">CPSA User Guide</a> describes a
  better way to analyze protocols when GNU Make is available.</p>

<p>After running the analysis, you will note files with the extension
<code>.xhtml</code>. These are XHTML/SVG compound documents that can be viewed by
standards compliant browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and
later versions of Internet Explorer.  See the section
on <a href="cpsauser.html#cpsagraph">visualization</a> in the user
guide for help interpreting these documents.</p>

<p>New users should study CPSA's analysis of the following protocols
  in order, Blanchet (<code>blanchet.xhtml</code>), Needham-Schroeder
  (<code>ns.xhtml</code>), Woo-Lam (<code>woolam.xhtml</code>), Yahalom
  (<code>yahalom.xhtml</code>), ffgg (<code>ffgg.xhtml</code>), and finally
  Otway-Rees (<code>or.xhtml</code>). When studying the full output,
  simultaneously display the extracted shapes. The shapes file has an
  extension of <code>_shapes.xhtml</code>.</p>

<p>To make effective use of CPSA, new users should scan the
  <a href="cpsauser.html">user guide</a> to get a flavor of its
  contents, and then read the <a href="cpsaprimer.pdf">primer</a>.
  The remainder of this document contains some usage tips to be read
  after running CPSA and learning to understand its output.</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<p>Choose a small, simple protocol for your first analysis task. When analyzing
complex protocols, analyze small parts of the protocol first, and then enrich
the description of the problem. </p>

<p>The source distribution contains additional programs and a test
  suite with many examples.  The README in the top-level directory of
  the source distribution contains the installation instructions and
  is essential reading for its effective use.  Serious users should
  favor the source distribution if on a Unix-like platform.</p>

<p>Authentication tests guide the search for new skeletons in CPSA.
  The authentication test solved at each step of the search is
  described by the <code>operation</code> form in CPSA output.  When CPSA
  generates unexpected output, find the first skeleton in the
  derivation tree that exhibits the problem and read
  the <code>operation</code> form to find out what happened.
  Authentication tests are introduced in
  the <a href="cpsaprimer.pdf">primer</a> and described in full
  detail in the <a href="cpsaspec.pdf">The CPSA
  Specification</a>.</p>

<p>An origination assumption
  (<code>non-orig</code>, <code>pen-non-orig</code>, and <code>unig-orig</code>),
  can be specified in a role or in a skeleton.  Be sure to read the
  advice in the <a href="cpsaprimer.pdf">primer</a> on the proper
  placement of origination assumptions.</p>

<p>Variables of sort message unify with any message.  See Otway-Rees
  (<code>or.xhtml</code>) for an example of the use of variables of this
  sort.</p>

<p>A quoted string is a constant of sort message and is called a tag.
  Tags can be used to distinguish messages that have similar
  structure in the case where the implementation of the protocol
  contains protections against message conflation.</p>

<p>Lisp-like macros in <code>cpsa</code> input can be used to replace
  multiple occurrences of a message with one named definition of it.
  Macros are described in the <a href="cpsaprimer.pdf">primer</a>.</p>

<p>When the <code>cpsagraph</code> program is given the <code>--zoom</code>
  option, it produces diagrams that scale.  This is useful when
  viewing large diagrams.</p>

<p>When the <code>cpsapp</code> program is given the <code>--json</code>
  option, it translates S-expressions into JavaScript Object
  Notation.</p>

<p>The <a href="cpsaspec.pdf">specification</a> describes the CPSA
  algorithm as a term reduction system.
  The <a href="cpsadesign.pdf">design</a> describes implementation
  choices made and should be read when viewing the source code.</p>
