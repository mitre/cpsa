<p>The Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer (CPSA) attempts to
  enumerate all essentially different executions possible for a
  cryptographic protocol. We call them the <i>shapes</i> of the
  protocol. Naturally occurring protocols have only finitely many,
  indeed very few shapes. Authentication and secrecy properties are
  easy to determine from them, as are attacks and anomalies.</p>

<p>CPSA comes with a user guide, a manual, a primer, goal
  documentation, and some slides.  The user guide provides usage
  information for each program in the CPSA package.  The
  <a href="cpsa4manual.pdf">manual</a> is the primary documentation.
  The primer provides an English language description of the CPSA
  algorithm.</p>

<p>At this point, new users should open the
  <a href="cpsaintroslides.pdf">introductory slides</a> and start
  using CPSA by analyzing the protocols that come with this document.
  Copy the contents of this directory to a place that allows it to be
  modified.  In a Unix shell, type:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>$ echo build | ghci Make.hs</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In Windows, click on <code>Make.hs</code> and type <code>build</code> at
  the <code>GHCi</code> prompt <code>*Make&gt;</code>.
  The <a href="cpsauser.html#make">CPSA User Guide</a> describes a
  better way to analyze protocols when GNU Make is available.</p>

<p>After running the analysis, you will note files with the extension
  <code>.xhtml</code>. These are XHTML/SVG compound documents that can
  be viewed by standards compliant browsers. See the section
  on <a href="cpsauser.html#cpsagraph">visualization</a> in the user
  guide for help interpreting these documents.</p>

<p>New users should study CPSA's analysis of the following protocols
  in order, Blanchet (<code>blanchet.xhtml</code>), Needham-Schroeder
  (<code>ns.xhtml</code>), Woo-Lam (<code>woolam.xhtml</code>),
  Yahalom (<code>yahalom.xhtml</code>), ffgg
  (<code>ffgg.xhtml</code>), and finally Otway-Rees
  (<code>or.xhtml</code>). When studying the full output,
  simultaneously display the extracted shapes. The shapes file has an
  extension of <code>_shapes.xhtml</code>.

<p>An analysis of Needham-Schroeder
  using <a href="cpsagoals.pdf">security goals</a> is
  in <code>goals.xhtml</code>.  Examples of using the security goal
  language for rewrite rules is in <code>rules.xhtml</code>.  These
  examples can safely be ignored by new users.</p>

<p>To make effective use of CPSA, new users should scan the
  <a href="cpsauser.html">user guide</a> to get a flavor of its
  contents, and then read the <a href="cpsaprimer.pdf">primer</a>.
  The remainder of this document contains some usage tips to be read
  after running CPSA and learning to understand its output.</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<p>Choose a small, simple protocol for your first analysis task. When
  analyzing complex protocols, analyze small parts of the protocol
  first, and then enrich the description of the problem. </p>

<p>The source distribution contains additional programs and a test
  suite with many examples.  The README in the top-level directory of
  the source distribution contains the installation instructions and
  is essential reading for its effective use.  Serious users should
  favor the source distribution if on a Unix-like platform.</p>

<p>Authentication tests guide the search for new skeletons in CPSA.
  The authentication test solved at each step of the search is
  described by the <code>operation</code> form in CPSA output.  When CPSA
  generates unexpected output, find the first skeleton in the
  derivation tree that exhibits the problem and read
  the <code>operation</code> form to find out what happened.
  Authentication tests are introduced in
  the <a href="cpsaprimer.pdf">primer</a> and described in full
  detail in the <a href="cpsaspec.pdf">The CPSA
  Specification</a>.</p>

<p>An origination assumption
  (<code>non-orig</code>, <code>pen-non-orig</code>,
  and <code>unig-orig</code>), can be specified in a role or in a
  skeleton.  Be sure to read the advice in
  the <a href="cpsaprimer.pdf">primer</a> on the proper placement of
  origination assumptions.</p>

<p>Variables of sort message unify with any message.  See Otway-Rees
  (<code>or.xhtml</code>) for an example of the use of variables of this
  sort.</p>

<p>A quoted string is a constant of sort message and is called a tag.
  Tags can be used to distinguish messages that have similar
  structure in the case where the implementation of the protocol
  contains protections against message conflation.</p>

<p>Lisp-like macros in <code>cpsa</code> input can be used to replace
  multiple occurrences of a message with one named definition of it.
  Macros are described in the <a href="cpsaprimer.pdf">primer</a>.</p>

<p>When the <code>cpsagraph</code> program is given
  the <code>--zoom</code> option, it produces diagrams that scale.
  This is useful when viewing large diagrams.</p>

<p>In CPSA, a security goal is expressed as a sentence in first-order
  logic.  It asserts that if some properties hold for a skeleton, then
  some other properties must hold for all shapes computed by CPSA
  starting with the skeleton.  Security goals can be used to state
  authentication and secrecy goals of a protocol.  See
  <a href="cpsagoals.pdf">CPSA Security Goals and Rules</a>.  An
  analysis of Needham-Schroeder using first-order logic is
  in <code>goals.xhtml</code>.  Examples of using the security goal
  language for rewrite rules is in <code>rules.xhtml</code>.</p>

<p>When the <code>cpsapp</code> program is given
  the <code>--json</code> option, it translates S-expressions into
  JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).  The <code>cpsajson</code>
  program translates JSON into S-expressions.  These two programs
  makes it easy to manipulate CPSA input and output using Python or
  other languages with JSON libraries.</p>

<p>The goal of CPSA is to automatically characterize the possible
  executions of a protocol compatible with a specified partial
  execution. There is a rigorous
  <a href="http://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/completeness-of-cpsa">proof</a>
  that the algorithm enumerates all of these characterizations.</p>

<p>The <a href="cpsaspec.pdf">specification</a> describes the CPSA
  algorithm as a term reduction system.
  The <a href="cpsadesign.pdf">design</a> describes implementation
  choices made and should be read when viewing the source code.</p>
