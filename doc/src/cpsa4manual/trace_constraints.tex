\label{chap:trace:constraints}

In some cases, one wants to declare properties that all of the
``real'' instances of a role must satisfy.  For instance, possibly two
parameters will never receive the same value, e.g.~because a server is
required to check that the client name in a transaction is different
from its own name.  {\cpsa} presents several ways of ensuring such
constraints, some of which may be logically indistinguishable as far
as {\cpsa} is concerned, while representing different operational
consequences for other tools, such as the Zappa {\cpsa}-to-Rust
compiler.
