(herald "Kerberos PKINIT")

;;; This file includes three versions of the Kerberos PKINIT
;;; protocol. The first version is the flawed version that Cervesato
;;; et al. analyzed in "Breaking and Fixing Public-Key Kerberos." The
;;; other two versions are the two fixes that are explored in the same
;;; paper.

;;; We also express the goal that the authors identify as a property
;;; not met by the original flawed version, but which both fixes do
;;; achieve. Running CPSA with this input demonstrates that the flawed
;;; version does not satisfy the goal, but both fixed versions do.

;;; How to use this file:
;;;
;;; CPSA looks at the goal and creates an initial point of view that
;;; corresponds to the information contained in the antecedent of the
;;; implication of the goal. It then outputs a characterization
;;; (consisting of shapes) of all executions containing at least the
;;; structure contained in the point of view. It then evaluates the
;;; goal against each of those shapes. The guarantee CPSA provides is
;;; that a goal is achieved iff each of the shapes satisfies the goal.

;;; We can look at the output in pkinit.xhtml to determine what CPSA
;;; discovered. Notice that the shape associated with the first
;;; analysis (of the flawed version) contains an annotation that says
;;; (satisfies (no (c c) (as as) (k k) (z (0 1)))). This means that
;;; the goal is not satisfied. The pairs of terms represent a variable
;;; assignment for the logical variables of the goal into elements of
;;; the shape. This is the variable assignment of the antecendant
;;; which has no extension for which the conclusion is also
;;; satisfied. The shapes for the other analyses contain the
;;; annotation (satisfies yes) indicating that the goal is satisfied
;;; in the shape (and hence in any realized skeleton).
