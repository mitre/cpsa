-- The preskeletons in the output are assembled together for display
-- into trees based on the parent relation.  In reality, the
-- relationship between preskeletons is not tree-like, but includes
-- other edges as a result of a preskeleton having cohort members that
-- have been seen before.  These members are called a tree node's
-- duplicates, and their children are displayed somewhere else in the
-- display.
